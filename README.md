## Problem definition

### General description:
The optimum power transmission of a toothed belt drive can only be guaranteed if the toothed belt is optimally pre-tensioned. Incorrect adjustment increases the load on all components involved and reduces efficiency. For this reason, the pre-tensioning force of the belt should be monitored during operation. Condition monitoring of the toothed belt drive is realised via machine learning procedures based on sensor signals from the machine. Feature engineering is an important tast during feature-based classification and is crucial for success. Shapelets are subsequences of the original data that are representative for a certain class. Therefore, they can be used for classification and offer the possibility to reveal data insights by highlighting distinguishable parts. 

### Tasks:
Within the scope of this bachelor thesis, the condition monitoring of toothed belt drives is carried out by means of machine learning based on shapelets. Various reference data sets are available, which can be used to evaluate the performance of all methods. It shall be investigated in which way shapelets can help to classify different belt tensions and gains data insights. For this purpose, suitabel methods for the detection of good shapelets will be selected after a literature search. After an investigation of all adjustable parameters of these algorithms, they are evaluated with respect to accuracy and required size of dataset.

In the context of this work, the following tasks arise in particular:
- Literature research on time series classification based on shapelets
- Selection and implementation of a shapelet detection algorithm
- Implementation of a shapelet classification
- Evaluation of all methods with respect to accuracy and data requirement
- Optional: Comparison with handcrafted feature-based approach
- Documentation of the results
